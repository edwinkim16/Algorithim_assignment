# Algorithims assignment

## Questiion 1 
Write an efficient recursive algorithm that takes a sentence, starting index and ending index.
The algorithm should then return a sentence that contain words between the starting and ending
indices. Write recurrence relation of your algorithm and find time complexity using tracing tree
method

## Question 2 
Write an efficient algorithm that takes an array A[n1...nn) of sorted integers and return an
array with elements that have been circularly shifted k positions to the right. For example a sorted
array A=[5, 15, 29, 35, 42] is converted to A[35, 42, 5, 15, 27, 29] after circularly shifted 2
positions, while the same array A =[5, 15, 29, 35, 42] is converted to A[27, 29, 35, 42, 5, 15] after
circularly shifted 4 positions. Write the recurrence relation of your solution and find the time
complexity of your algorithm using iterative method
